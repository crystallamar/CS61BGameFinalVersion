The Maze

This game is designed for children to have fun while practicing their colors, numbers and letters. 
The project is accessible for children with special needs or mobility impairments.

The game opens with a start screen that allows you to load a previous save file or start a new game.

When the game starts up, the user's avatar is placed somewhere in the maze. In order to win the game they must collect all three coins and complete the trials associated with them.

Once the user collects a coin, a new screen will appear where they must collect the coins in order of ROYGBV, 1-6, or A-F to successfully complete the trial.

After each trial has been completed, the win condition will trigger and the player will be directed to a page congratulating them for successfully completing the game and giving them the option to quit or play again.

About the Development:

I LOVED working designing and developing this project. When this assignment was given to me, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. 
The idea actually came to me after working with one of my kiddos with special needs*.
I told him about a text adventure I had created in the past and he wanted to see it.
I showed him a basic one online, but was saddened to realize that his mobility impairment made it impossible for him to play it.
He uses one button he can press with his knee to interact with his whole computer!
Upon this interaction, I decided that I wanted to do something for my kids that could be a fun learning adventure that was available for everyone. 
I put approximately 150 hours into this project and plan to continue adding more accessibility features.

*I work through school as an Registered Behavior Technician AKA I help kiddos with special needs
